## Strategy 1: Optimize SEO

Search Engine Optimization is the foundation of organic traffic growth. When your site ranks high in search results, you attract qualified visitors actively looking for what you offer.

### Key SEO Tactics

**Technical SEO**
- Ensure fast page load times
- Make your site mobile-friendly

## Strategy 2: Content Marketing

Content attracts, educates, and converts. When you consistently create valuable content, you build trust and authority that drives organic traffic over time.
